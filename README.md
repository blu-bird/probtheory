# Probability Theory
## Spring 2020, TJHSST

These files contain the in-progress lecture notes for Dr. White's probability theory text. If you'd like to contribute to the repo, please clone to your local machine (or I think you can link with overleaf.com), and edit *chapter files only*. You can latex individual chapters without having to compile the entire book if you'd like. Put any images in the images/CC folder
where CC is the chapter number.

Style guide: use section and subsection as appropriate. Also use theorem, proof and example environments. Then submit a pull request to github for me to merge in your work. Thanks!!
